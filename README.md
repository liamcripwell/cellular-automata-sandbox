# cellular-automata-sandbox

The following is an Elm webapp for cellular automata exploration. Currently, it only includes a version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) by default, but I will aim to include additional features at a later date.

After cloning, run ```elm reactor``` in the project directory and visit ```http://localhost:8000/``` to view the app.
